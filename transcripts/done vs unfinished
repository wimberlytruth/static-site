Efficient Workflow

1. scan
2. ocr with tesseract
3. mark page numbers with comment tags
4. find missing pages, insert <hr> tag in those gaps

5. delete the garbage lines caused by hand writing; tesseract usually 
separates garbage text and quality text into separate lines, so the process of looking for 
garbage and deleting it becomes a simple line-by-line activity.

6. find the paragraph transitions within each page. then select the entire paragraph, press 
Ctrl+Shift+P, which will pull up the command palette in VSCode -- search for Join Line. 
This will put the paragraph on one single line.

7. paste the annotation tag as a mark for where hand-written notes are in the pdf files. 
don't count/number the tags -- it's a hassle and you can easily count them with ctrl+F, using the tag for a query. 
also, include underlining.

8. Run Chrome spellcheck on the html files, and edit them accordingly.
