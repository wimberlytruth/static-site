DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. WHITE:

Good morning.

Morning.

Would you please state your name for the record.

Matthew Wimberly.

Move that microphone a little bit closer to you if you would.

                  (Witness complied with request.)

Is that better?

That's better.
Matt, September 22, 2013, where were you living?

I was living at the house on -- is it 3323 East Victor?

Uh-huh. And who were your roommates?

Jonmark Herrscher and Justin Malter.

On September 21, 2013, were you working anyplace in the evening?

Yes. I was working at John Barleycorns running sound for the band that night.

And what time did you leave John Barleycorns?

It was around the time the bar closed, so about 2:00.

Do you remember what time you arrived back at your residence?

Shortly thereafter. I would say within ten, 15 minutes of that.

And who was at the residence when you arrived?

Jonmark, Justin, and Andrew.

Was anybody with you when you arrived back at the residence?

Yes. My girlfriend Lelle and her cousin Adrian.

And when you got back to the residence what did you guys do?

We just walked in and sat down in the front room, Jonmark's bedroom, and just hung out there for a little bit.

Okay. Was anyone smoking marijuana?

Possibly.

All right. Did you smoke any marijuana?

Possibly. I'm sure if it was being passed around I probably did.

Okay. Did you ever see Andrew once you got back to the house?

Yes.

Would you describe your interaction with Andrew once you got back to the house. Tell the jury what happened.

As soon as I got home and we walked inside I remember almost immediately him asking me -- he goes, hey, do you want to do acid with me and I agreed to it. He handed me the hit, and I said, how much do you want for</pre>
<hr/>

<pre>

need to go outside; correct?

Yes.

And are Justin and Jonmark already asleep when you go outside?

I'm not sure.

Is it possible?

Maybe. Probably.

Okay. And as far as Andrew, you don't have an independent recollection of Andrew, necessarily, following you outside, do you?

I can't remember that for sure.

Is it possible that he stayed in the house when you went outside?

It's possible.

Is it possible at some point -- because, again, you don't know how long you're outside, do you?

No.

Is it possible at some point while you were outside he laid down somewhere in the house?

I couldn't say for sure.

Because you don't know --

No.

-- in all fairness; right? Because you're outside, correct?

Right.



Okay. And then -- and also, you know, obviously you spent this time with Andrew back in the bedroom. Was it your understanding that Andrew was going to be staying the rest of the evening at the house?

Yeah. There was no way at that point that either one of us would probably go to sleep.

Fair enough. Maybe not go to sleep, but you were staying at that house.

Yes.

There was no talk of him leaving to go somewhere else or someone coming to pick him up or anything like that?

No.

Now, you were asked or you relayed to the jury some of the effects of the injuries you sustained. And to be candid, you're talking about the injuries sustained by Jonmark hitting you over the back and head with this bat and baton and whatever else he hit you with; correct?

Yes.

You heard him testify; you're aware of his prior statements. You now know why he was hitting you with those items; correct?

Yes.

It was because you were in the process of stabbing and otherwise attacking Andrew in the kitchen of the house

that night; correct?

That's my understanding of it.

And you can understand why Jonmark would be doing that; can't you?

Yes.

You made a point of talking about some of the physical difficulties you dealt with after this, but you're aware, you know, as you had a broken skull or a fractured skull you understand Andrew had a knife blade four inches deep into his brain; correct?

Yes.

And that he's continued to have memory loss, difficulty holding down a job, all the things that he testified to here in court this week?

Yes.

And that those injuries were at your hands; correct?

Yes.

You were asked if you had an intent to kill or harm or do anything to Andrew that night. And your testimony was that prior to taking that drug you don't recall having that intent; correct?

Prior to the effects of this drug kicking in I had no intention at all.

Okay. But while all these events have happened, and you -- you know, you know what happened now, you don't

  

have an independent recollection of those things; correct?

No.

So you can't say what your actions were, what your thought processes were to this jury; correct?

No.

And you made the point of saying that you're now here today taking responsibility for what you've done, but you also made a point that everyone needed to take responsibility; correct?

Yes, sir.
 
Fair to say that you don't think it's fair that you're charged with a crime and Andrew Langston isn't?

All I'm really saying is, you know, there's -- in this case it really does take two to tango. I mean, I believe -- I can't contest or dispute any of this and I believe I should be held, you know, accountable for my actions. But without this drug, without him selling me this drug, giving me this drug, none of this would have happened. So he did play his part --

Sure.

-- is all I'm saying.

And it was your choice to join that dance; correct?

Yes. It was my -- it was a mistake, but, yes, it was my choice. <i><b><span style="background: #ff7f50">annotation 1</span></b></i></pre>

THE COURT: All right. Thank you, Mr. Shannon.

Good morning, Your Honor.

MR. WHITE: One more, Judge.

THE COURT: One more. And your name, sir?

MR. NATHAN SORIA: Nathan Soria. I've known
Matt for 29 years. Matt Wimberly is my best friend and
never, ever known him to be a violent person.

Only a kind, caring, good friend, a loving father and a very competent musician. I too am sorry that this man was involved, and for Andrew and for all of this. It's a horrible accident. And I too hope that he doesn't spend a great part of his life in prison. Thank you.

THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Soria.

Further evidence that you want to present in mitigation, then, Mr. White, other than Mr. Wimberly?

MR. WHITE: No, sir.

THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Wimberly, now would be your time to let me know what you think I need to hear, present in evidence that you want to present in mitigation of punishment before I impose sentence.

<i><b><span style="background: #ff7f50">annotation 2</span></b></i>
THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, Your Honor. I've waited a very, very long time for this day to be able to publicly apologize. The ripples of this event are so vast and far reaching it's almost hard -- impossible to comprehend sometimes. So many people have been affected by this one event. Andrew Langston and his family, Jonmark Herrscher and his family, Justin Malter and his family and my family, and I'm sure it goes beyond that. This is a tragedy any way you look at it from any side. I'm a father myself and I can understand how the Langston's must feel about me and I don't blame them at all. I would feel the same way. I hope -- I know these are just words but I hope by hearing them everyone involved may find some sort of peace and some sort of comfort in them. From the very bottom of my heart I am truly sorry for everything. For any pain that anybody has experienced, for everything or any effect that has happened. I don't expect to be forgiven, but I do hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me for my actions for I do take responsibility for them.
And without this drug none of this would have happened. I know this. I know who I am. I know who I'm not. I was not in my right state of mind. And if I had been -- if I had been in my right state of mind and had done these things, I would expect, and I would also agree, with the book just being thrown at me. I'm here to tell you this is not me. This is not an example of who I am or who I've been or who I will be.
I've been in here for 19 months and I've thought about this every day and everyone of you have been in my prayers. I'm trying to forgive myself for this. My recollection of this night is not -- it's almost nonexistent. I feel that both Andrew and I are both very lucky to be alive and I thank God that we both are. If I could take all of this back I would a million times over. But we all know that I can't.
What's done is done. But I am truly sorry for it and I hope you all may find some peace and comfort in that if that's even possible. And I hope that there can be some kind of closure and finality in this and that everyone can at least attempt to go on with their lives and not have this affect them and not be defined by it.
I wish and hope the best for Andrew Langston. I don't feel he is a bad person. I never did. And all I can do here is stand here and say that I'm sorry. I have nothing but regret and remorse for this. And I hope -- I just hope everyone can take some sort of comfort from that.
You know, I can relate to Andrew telling his grandmother that he felt he died that night because I feel I died that night. I don't feel I was a bad person before, and it may sound clich√©, but the man standing before you today is a changed man. I've tried to make the best of a bad situation and I've tried to do all I can to grow and heal, which I am still healing as well.
I throw myself at the mercy of this court, Your Honor. I hope -- I hope you all can forgive me.
I would also like to thank Ms. Purk, Andrew's mother, for reaching out to my mother. I've come to understand that you've both been supportive of each other through this and I think that's very kind and very compassionate. I just wanted to thank you for that. And I hope that you've both helped each other, that it's helped both of you equally. Thank you for your time.

THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Wimberly.
Well, the Court will find that the primary offense is Count 1, which calls for a prison term of 184, 195 or 203 months and a postrelease supervision duration of 36 months.
Let me start with the motion for departure. Mr. Wimberly, I have not doubt that the remarks that you provided were sincere and I have no doubt it is very difficult to make those remarks. I also have no doubt that it's as difficult for the family of Mr. Langston to be here and address the Court as it is for your
