<h2>John Mark Herrscher</h2>
<!-- page 1 -->Is that a yes?

Yes.

Thank you. How did you come to live at 3325 East Victor?

It was my pop's place. He passed away and I took over the lease.

When you took over the lease, did you have any individuals living with you at that house?

Yes, I did.

And who were those people?	<span class="annotation">annotation #1, pg 1</span>

Justin Malter and Mr. Wimberly here.

How long did you know Mr. Wimberly at the time September 22, 2013? How long had you known him?

Maybe six to eight months, somewhere around there.

How long had you known Justin Malter?

Close to four years.

Where did you and Justin meet?

At high school.

Prior to September 22, 2013, how long had you lived at 3325 East Victor?

I had lived there, maybe, two to three years before I moved out. My father still lived there.

Did you live there with your father?

Yes. And I moved out and he still lived there.

I'm sorry?
<!--page 2-->
When I moved out he lived there as well.

And when he passed away you moved back in?

Yes.

Were you and Mr. Justin Malter friends?

Yeah. Yes.

And what about you and Mr. Wimberly?

Yes.

How did you meet Mr. Wimberly?

I had met him through a man that I met at a place where I was working at. I had met him through a fellow named Brian Magers [ph].

So you had a mutual friend?

Yes.

And at the time that you were living there on September 22nd, did you have a job?

Yes. Oh, at the time of the incident?

Yes, sir.

No, I did not.

Were you on unemployment?

Yes, I was.

Did Justin Malter have a job?

Yes, he did.

Do you know where he was working?

It was either at the Anchor or a place called Empire Catering. I am not for sure on which one.
<hr/> <!-- page gap -->
<!-- page 3 -->
did too.

Where did Justin Malter sleep?

He kind of slept back here in the -- I guess it would be a dining room (indicating).

Okay. So you turned the dining room into a bedroom?

Yeah.

Where did Mr. Wimberly sleep?

He slept back here in this room (indicating).

That's at the bottom of that diagram?

Yeah.

You can have a seat, sir.

			(Witness complied with request.)

September 21st you're at your home. In the evening hours, who is all at your home?

It was Justin Malter and myself.

At some point in time did Andrew Langston come over?

Yes.

Approximately what time was that?

It was, maybe, about 10:00 when he first came over.

10:00 in the evening.

And at that time was it just you, Justin and Andrew?

Yes. And Matt as well.				   

<span class="annotation">annotation #2, pg 3</span>

Matt was there?

Yes.

Did anyone else arrive with Mr. Wimberly?
<!-- page 4 -->
I believe his girlfriend.

Do you recall her name?

Libby.

Libby?

If I'm not mistaken.

Do you know anyone by the name of Lelle?

Yeah. That's sounds more along the lines of who his girlfriend is.

Okay. So at some point in time it's you, Justin, Andrew, Mr. Wimberly and his girlfriend. Anybody else that you can recall?

Not that I remember, no.

And at this point in time, what's going on at your house?

Not a whole lot. I mean, we were just kind of hanging out.

Why did Andrew come over? Do you know?

He had come over to party.

Were there drugs in the house?

Yes.

Okay. Marijuana?

Yes.

At some point in time did you observe any -- what's commonly referred to as acid?

I had seen Andrew with it, but I didn't see him take it.
<!-- page 5 -->
I mean, I knew that he had it. He showed it to me.

	MR. DWYER: Can I have 21, please?
	(Exhibit displayed.)

	MR. DWYER: Thank you.

Jonmark, we're looking at State's Exhibit 21 on the screen. Is this the front door to your house?

Yes, it is.

And is that your bed that we taliked about in State's Exhibit 19 in the diagram?

Yes, it is.

When everyone was hanging out, was everyone basically in the living room?

Yes.

If we go on to State's Exhibit 22, this is, again, another picture of your bed; correct?

Yes.

And in 23 the room that we're looking at to the left of the Douglas Design District banner, that's the dining room where Justin slept?

That is correct.

This is your living room table in 24. And this is -- State's Exhibit 25, this is an end table. There's what appears to be a bong sitting on that end table; correct?
<!--page 6-->
Yes.

Now, this end table, is this near your bed?

Yes. Just a few feet away.

Okay. So if we go back to State's Exhibit 22, it's to the left of that orange sort of leather chair; is that right?

Yes.

All right. At some point in time, does Andrew leave the house?

Yes.

Do you know where he went? Did he go to the store? Did he go to --

I believe that they had went down to the corner store to get some cigarettes.

Okay. When you say corner store, where are you talking about?

It's at Douglas and Waterman. It used to be a Valero. I think it's Phillips 66 now.

It's a gas station?

Yeah.

And it is across from like a Dillons?

No. It's right across the street from an insurance building and right next to the ear, nose and throat specialist right there on Hillside.

So it's south of Douglas?

<hr/><!-- page gap -->
<!--pg 7-->

He was just talking about I found it.

Did you know what "it" was?

I assumed it was God or Jesus or something, but I really don't know.

And where was Andrew at this time?

Andrew hadn't came over quite yet. It was -- Matt had been there maybe about 15 minutes before Andrew came in.

And when you say Andrew came in, did Andrew come in the front door, the kitchen door, or do you know?

The kitchen door.

Did you see him come in the kitchen door?

No, because I can't see the kitchen door from the living room.

You just know he didn't come in through the front door?

Yes.

And before Andrew comes in during this -- did you say it was ten, 15 minutes?

Yes.

What was Mr. Wimberly doing and saying at this time?

He was just talking crazy. I mean he --

When you say talking crazy, are you talking about finding "it", finding Jesus?

Yes. And it was here. And just a bunch of nonsense.

Before Andrew shows up, is Mr. Wimberly acting angry?
<!--page 8-->
No, he is not.

Was he acting aggressive?

No, he is not.

Was he threatening you or Justin?

No, sir.

When Andrew comes in, is it fair to say you come through the dining room area?

Yes.

And that's the door we are talking about in 23; correct?

Yes, sir.

What happens when Andrew walks in the room?

Just the whole atmosphere changed. Mr. Wimberly changed. Just his whole facial expression, his body language, everything. He just -- he zoned in on Andrew and all he said was, I'm going to kill that motherfucker.

You say his expression changed. Tell the jury what you saw.

He just -- he was just sitting there, you know, kind of out of it and looks at him and kind of -- just 100 percent focused on Andrew.

Is he staring?

Yes. Glaring.

Glaring. All right. Says I'm going to kill the mother
<hr/><!--page gap-->
<!--page 9-->
black handle.

When you say seven inches, you're including the handle?

Yes.

And did you see Mr. Wimberly pull it out?

Yes, I did.

And where was it? Where did he produce it from?

His pocket.

In the context of what we're talking about, does he say it before -- does he pull -- excuse me. Does he produce the knife prior to him saying I'm going to kill that mother fucker or after?

After.

When you see this knife, do you do anything?

I had asked Mr. Wimberly -- I was like, you know, what's going on? Why are you doing this? I had tried to diffuse the situation and I didn't get anywhere. and Justin Malter, he is better to talking to people than I am, and he actually convinced Matt to drop his knife and calm down a little bit.

Did Mr. Wimberly drop the knife?

Yes, he did.

And where did he drop it? Just on the floor or --

Just on the floor at his feet.

When the knife was dropped, what did you do?

I picked it up and I closed the blade and I sat it on 
<!--pg 10-->
the night stand next to my bed.

All right. So when we're talking about the nightstand, is it the table next to your bed with a lamp on it?

Yes.

Now, when you're sitting on the bed next to Mr. Wimberly, is Mr. Wimberly sitting closer to the table or are you?

I'm sitting closest to the table. He would be to my left.

Okay. So he's down on this end of the bed somewhat (indicating)?

Yes, sir.

Okay. Thank you. After you picked up the knife and closed the blade and set it on the table, what happens at that point?

Matt had actually calmed down for a few minutes and then, you know, we were just kind of, you know, okay, you know, the situation is diffused. And it was just seconds -- I mean, Matt, he had got that face -- that look on his face again, and he reached back over and picked up his knife.

Does he open the knife at this time?

Yes, sir.

So you said he got that face. When you say he got that
<hr/><!--page gap-->
<!--pg 11-->
At some point in time you make a second call to 911; is that right?

Yes, sir.

When do you make that call?

It was, maybe, even as long as 20 minutes to a half an hour after I had called the police the first time.

Did you have a watch with you?

No.

Were you looking at the clock when you were calling?

No. This is just estimates. It was the night of that Old Town shooting that they had, and, you know, they couldn't send an officer. I mean --

Did you know that at the time?

No, I did not. I didn't know that until afterwards.

	MR. WHITE: Your Honor, I will ask that that answer be stricken from the record.

	<span class="annotation">annotation #3, pg 11</span>
								
	THE COURT: Sustained.

(BY MR. DWYER) When you called 911 the second time, where are you at when you make the call? I was in the kitchen again. So you had gone out, you screamed for help. You come back into the kitchen and you pick up -- is it Andrew's phone again?

Yes, sir.

And you made a second call to 911?
<!--pg 12-->
Yes, sir.

When that's going on, what are Andrew and Mr. Wimberly doing?

I remember Mr. Wimberly had had his hands over his head and he was rocking back and forth on his elbows and knees, just kind of grunting. Andrew -- I remember at one point in time, he had started to go into a seizure and he was starting to shake and stuff, so I ran over there and I grabbed his head and turned it to the side.

And was this before or after that second call?

I believe it was after.

At some point in time does Andrew make it to the screen door?

Yes, but not on his own.

Okay. Tell me what happens between that second phone call and the seizure, what you call a seizure, to the time where Andrew somehow gets to that screen door.

What's happening?

Well, I had continued to hit Mr. Wimberly as he kept trying to go towards Andrew. And every time he would to go towards Andrew I would always hit him to get off. And eventually my bat broke, so I went into other room and I grabbed an old police baton that my dad had.

And you came back to the room, I take it?
<hr/><!--page gap-->
<!--pg 13-->
the officers? Do you recall how long the officers were there in order to separate -- how long it took them to separate Mr. Wimberly and Andrew?

<span class="annotation">annotation #4, pg 13</span>

It took quite a long time. Because the first officer that showed up, he was trying to get them off and he just -- he couldn't, and then more and more officers started showing up. And eventually Matt still had ahold of Andrew and there was maybe four or five cops trying to separate them. It just wasn't happening. And finally they had jostled Andrew free and I remember I grabbed him by the feet, and I pulled him out of just like a whole mix of people to get him away.

Okay. I'm going to move to State's Exhibit 8 here, and I know it's kind of a blurry picture. Does this picture -- can you tell in this picture -- can you tell the jury where Andrew's body was when you pulled him away?

I was probably where those pools of blood are.

Was that in the center of the picture, the pools that have kind of run to the bottom of the picture?

Yeah. And maybe in between that pool of blood and these two right here (indicating.)

When you say that pool of blood, you're talking about
<!--pg 14-->
the one just next to the black and let's say gray --

Yes.

Do ambulances show up?

Yes, sir.

Where is Justin -- did you ever see Justin Malter again?

Yes. He comes back after the police and the ambulances had arrived.

Does he show up on while the ambulances are still there?

Yes, sir.

As the officers -- do you know what happened to Mr. Wimberly when the ambulances show up? Was he loaded into an ambulance?

Yes, sir.

What did you do after he was loaded into an ambulance?

I remember it was chilly out and all I had on was some slippers and my jeans, and I asked the officers if I could go back inside and grab a shirt.

Did they let you get a shirt or jacket or anything?

Yes, sir.

How are you feeling at this point in time?

I was -- I was not feeling too hot.

What do you mean by that? Were you excited, were you anxious, scared?
<!--pg 15-->
I was definitely having some anxiety. I was just - remember I was just -- I was so just shooken up about the whole thing. I couldn't even believe it happened.

Did you speak to some officers about what had happened?

Yes, sir.

Do you recall how many officers you told this story to?

Two or three.

	MR. DWYER: May I have just a moment, Your Honor?

	THE COURT: Sure.
	
	(Mr. Dwyer conferred with Mr. Breitenbach.)

Jonmark, that's all the question I have. Mr. White may have some questions for you; okay?

Okay.
	THE COURT: Cross?

	MR. WHITE: Thank you, Judge.

	CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. WHITE:

Jonmark, good afternoon.

Good afternoon, sir.

How are you?

Oh, I've been better.

If there is a question of mine that you understand, would you let me know?					
<!--pg 16-->
Yes, sir.

All right. Fair enough. On September 21, 2013, you were residing at 3325 East Victor Place; is that correct?

Yes, sir.

Now, at that time, late in the evening of that day, you just told this jury that you, Justin Malter, Andrew, Matt Wimberly and Lelle were the only people in that residence; is that correct?                                
<span class="annotation">annotation #5, pg 16</span>

Yes, sir.

No one else was there?

Not that I can recall.

Do you recall a person by the name of Nathan?

No, sir.

You don't recall a Nathan?				 

No, sir.

Do you recall a cousin of Lelle?           
<span class="annotation">annotation #6, pg 16</span>

Was it a boy or a girl?

You don't recall any other people other than what you told this jury as being in the residence; is that correct?

Yes, sir. I don't recall anybody else except the people I mentioned.

Okay. You stated that you -- on September 22, 2013, you had told this story to two or three different
<hr/><!-- page gap-->
<!-- pg 17 -->
Okay. Did you tell that officer that Matt said I'm going to kill this mother fucker?

I do believe so.

If he didn't report that, would he be in error?

Yes.

Because you told him about that?

I believe I told him that.

If he has in quotes your words, which were I'm going to stab him, would you object to that?

	MR. DWYER: Judge, I am going to object. It assumes facts not in evidence.

	MR. WHITE: It is in evidence. It is in Officer Adams' report.

	THE COURT: Overruled.

(BY MR. WHITE) Okay. So you're saying that you told Officer Adams that Matt said he was going to kill him?

Yes.

Okay. Did you tell that to Officer Nixon?

I believe so, yeah.

If Officer Nixon states that you didn't say that, could Officer Nixon be mistaken?

I would think so, because I've told the same story to --

The same story. Okay. Isn't it true Wimberly didn't even get to the residence till around 
<!--pg 18-->
12:30 on 9-22 of 2013?

I don't know. I was most likely asleep then.

So you haven't told any officers that the first time that you had seen Matt Wimberly was on September 22, 2013, when he came home from doing a deal with John Barleycorns at about 12:30 in the morning? That's inaccurate?

Well, if I told him that, I don't recall it because it's been so long now. I can't remember every word that I said that we spoke.

I understand. But if you made that statement on September 22 2013, right after this incident happened, do you think that your memory would be better then or better now?

Well, of course my memory would have been better then.

And you made a statement a second time approximately three hours later to Officer Nixon. Do you think your memory would be better then or better now?

I don't know that I can answer that question.

And you have a third interview approximately September 22nd -- excuse me, the 26th. Do you think that your memory would be better then or better now?

I mean, I don't know because I can't even remember that far back. I mean, as far as like what was said to the officers. I know I told them the story of what
<hr/><!--page gap-->
<!--pg 19-->
So what happens at that point?

Matt's whole demeanor changes and he zones in on Andrew and almost immediately he says I am going and kill that mother fucker.

Okay. Why didn't you tell that to Officer Nixon?

I probably spaced it. I mean, I was so frazzled and worked up at the time. I mean, Jesus, after what I'd just gone through. You know, if I missed a couple of things, I apologize for that.

Well, I'm going to kill someone versus I'm going to stab someone is a big, key difference, don't you think?

Well, I mean, don't they all end at the same place?

No. Do you remember being asked specifically by Officer Nixon did he use the words I'm going to kill him, and you said no.

He said I'm going to kill that mother fucker.

You don't remember Officer Nixon asking you that specific question? If he used any other verbiage like to kill him and you said no.

That's -- I am not disputing if that’s what I said. However, I don't remember him asking me that question. If it's on an interview, you wouldn't dispute the interview, would you?

No.

Okay. So Andrew comes back and he's there for how 
<!--pg 20 -->
long?     

He was there ~- it really wasn't all that long. Less than 20 minutes.

Okay. So that puts us to around 4:10; is that correct?

Sounds about right.

3:30 and 20 minutes, that's 3:40, another 20 minutes, that's 4:10; is that correct?

That sounds about right give or take five minutes.

And during that 20-minute period you're saying that Matt is sitting there staring at Andrew telling him he was going to kill the mother fucker; right?

Yes, sir.

And Andrew stands there for 20 minutes and doesn't say one word; is that correct?

No. He was like, what are you talking about? You know, he was just as confused as Justin and I.

Do you remember telling Officer Nixon that Andrew just stood there and didn't say one word?

I don't remember that.

Tf it's in the transcript, would you object to that? Would you think that that's inaccurate?

Well, I mean, from what I can recall, Andrew, it doesn't sound like he wouldn't say anything. I mean, I might have just said that. I mean, you know, gosh, I
<hr/><!--page gap-->
<!--pg 21-->
MR. DWYER: Objection, beyond the scope and relevance.

	THE COURT: Overruled.

Yes.

(BY MR. WHITE) Okay. So Andrew didn't first arrive at 10:00 p.m., he was there at noon; is that correct? Yeah.

What was he doing there at noon?

I imagine we were just hanging out. That was quite a long time ago.

What were you doing?

I don't know. I mean, we might have cooked something and ate it, we might have walked down to the park, we might have watched a movie, played some video games. I don't know.

Okay. What happened from noon until 10:00 p.m. between
you and Andrew?

I know that Andrew had left. I don't know where he went.

When did he leave?

I don't know. I just know that he wasn't there.

And so how long was he there?

I don't know. I don't remember. That was a long time ago.

Is that when he showed you the acid?
<!--pg 22-->
No.

When did he show you the acid?

He had showed me the acid that night.

You had said that when Matt came back to the house that he was knocking on the front door; do you remember that?

Yes.

Okay. And if I'm correct, did you state that Matt came in the front door or the kitchen door?

I believe that I let him in the front door.

Okay.

I know that Andrew came in the kitchen, though.

Okay. Now, Matt lived there; right?

Yes.

Was the front door locked?

Yes.

Was the kitchen door locked?

I don't think it was. Actually, I -- now that I remember, it wasn't because I remember telling him to go use the kitchen door.

All right. Do you remember telling the officers that Matthew came in the kitchen door?

No.

Okay. So when Matt first arrives he's telling you he found Jesus, it's here, come walk with me.
<!--pg 23-->
Yeah. I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?

All right. When Matt first arrives you said that he said I found Jesus, it's here, come walk with me.

Yeah. He was saying all that. I found it. It's here.

Okay. Did that seem strange?

Yeah.

And it wasn't until he saw Andrew that Matt becomes agitated; is that correct?

Yes, sir.

Is it at all possible that Matt was not in your front room for 20, 30 minutes, it was more like five minutes?

It's possible, yeah.

Is it possible that Andrew, when he came back, came back virtually simultaneously with Matt? Is that possible?

Sure.

Okay. Is it possible that Andrew just didn't stay there 20 minutes or so in your front room, that it more like, maybe, five minutes or less? Is that possible?

No, because I know that he stayed longer than five minutes.

Okay. You were not in fear of Andrew getting hurt; is that correct?

No -- well, not until he had picked up the knife again 
<!--pg 24-->
and then I was in fear for Andrew's life.

Why not take the knife away from Matt?

That's what I did, and then he reached over and picked it back up.

Well, you put it on the night table.

Yes.

You're saying that he is saying that he was going to kill Andrew; correct?

Yeah.

Why not take the knife completely away from Matt? Unarm him. Take it completely away from him.

Well, because I just didn't think about that. You know, I figured I'll sit it on the nightstand until the morning and then I'll give it back to him when he sobers up. 

<span class="annotation">annotation #7, pg 24</span>

All right. Okay. Do you remember telling one of the officers that you could clearly tell that Matt was under the influence?

Yes.

Okay. The officers arrive and Matt and Andrew are half in the kitchen and half out of the kitchen; do you remember that?

Yes.

Officer Adams arrives?

Yes.
<hr/><!--page gap-->
<!--pg 25-->
You didn't intend to kill Matt?

No.

You're swinging a bat multiple times --

	MR. DWYER: Judge, I'm going to object as argumentative, beyond the scope and relevance.

	MR. WHITE: This is not irrelevant. There is a point here.

THE COURT: Overruled.

(BY MR. WHITE) You're swinging a bat multiple times; correct?

Yes, sir.

You are not intending to kill him; correct?

I didn't want to kill him, no.

Right.

However, I believe that if he would have died, that would have been a consequence of his own actions.

If who would have died?

Mr. Wimberly.

It would have been the consequence of his own actions?

Yes, sir.

Because he was on acid that he got from Andrew Langston?

Yes, sir.

	MR. WHITE: No further questions.

	THE COURT: Why don't we take a short recess 
<!--pg 26-->
	before we do redirect and recross.
	Members of the jury, it's approaching 3:30, so it's time to take our afternoon recess. Why don't we take about ten minutes. If you'd be excused into the jury room, we'll come get you when we are ready to resume.

	(A recess was taken, after which the following proceedings were had.)

      	THE COURT: We are back on the record. The record should reflect we have got parties and counsel in the courtroom and the jury has joined us.
  	Prior to the afternoon recess, Mr. Dwyer, you were about to begin your redirect.

	MR. DWYER: Thank you, sir.

	REDIRECT EXAMINATION
	BY MR. DWYER:

Mr. Herrscher, how old were you at that time?

I was 19 -- 18.

You were 18 years old?

Yes, sir.

This happened some 18 months ago?

Yes, sir.

You had smoked some marijuana that night?

Yes.

When Mr. Wimberly came to the house, you had been
<hr/><!--page gap-->
<!--pg 27-->
listened to the interview -- well, at any time, but particularly contemporaneous to his statement to Detective Hall.

	THE COURT: Okay. All right. Well, if that's the stipulation of the parties.

	MR. WHITE: Thank you.

(BY MR. WHITE) Now, Jonmark, did you go over your interview with Officer Nixon with Detective Hall? 

I don't think so. I was only in Officer Hall's office maybe -- I mean it was less than 20 minutes. I came all the way down from Newton for something that took less than half an hour.

Okay.

So I don't believe so, no.

Twenty pages of interviews, that's quite a long time; don't you think? With officer Nixon.

It depends on how fast you read, I suppose.

Forty pages of an interview with Detective Hall, that's kind of a long time; correct?

(Nodded head up and down.)

So in reviewing this, do you still state that Matt came home at 10:00 p.m.?

Yes.			<span class="annotation">annotation #8, pg 27</span>

Not at 12:30?

No. Not at 12:30.
<!--pg 28-->
That Andrew was there at noon, 10:00 and 11:00 and not at 12:30 and 3:30? I am just trying to get it straight. Is the timeline that you first see Matt at 12:30 a.m. on 9-22-2013, not at 10:00 p.m. on 9-21-2013? Which is correct? 											
<span class="annotation">annotation #9, pg 28</span>

I just -- I mean, I remember like the sequence of events as far as actually what happened. It was 18 months ago. I can't remember the exact times when it's 18 months later. Look, I can tell you how the events unfolded that night. But I can only give you, you know, the best of my knowledge as to what times these things happened.

And that's fair. Let me ask you this: When Matt's moving on the
ground you felt it was necessary to hit him; is that correct?

For some of -- when he was moving closer to Andrew I sure did, yeah.

	MR. WHITE: No further questions.

	THE COURT: Further questions for Mr. Herrscher?

	MR. WHITE: No. Not by the State.

	THE COURT: Okay. Sir, you can step down.

	THE WITNESS: Okay. Thank you.

	MR. BREITENBACH: Your Honor, we'll call
