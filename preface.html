    PREFACE
    
    <p>
      I've also sent along some definitions pulled from Blacks Law Dictionary - 5th
      Edition as well Webster's College Dictionary to reference and exemplify that in my
      "State of Mind" on the night, I simply was not able to form the necessary requirements
      of (1. Intent; and 2. Pre-meditation ) ... [Compare definition of "Intoxication" w/ "Hallucination". and/or Intoxicating Liquor w/ Hallucinogen).
    </p>

    <p>
      Intent and Premeditation were both needed to have been found guilty of Attempted First Degree Murder.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summation, I have been overcharged, and never should have been found guilty of this
      charge, but don't take my word on it, read the information,medical records,and all
      the evidence that was ignored by and never presented by the courts.

      <ol>
        <li>Blotter paper</li>
        <li>Brown in color</li>
        <li>Very bitter taste (very unusual). See pg 21.</li>
        <li>Swallowed the drug in order to eat a sandwich as I'd just got off work and was hungry.</li>
        <li>Expected it to be weak. (Like the week before.)</li>
        <li>Was told was "Quadruple Dipped" after I'd already swallowed it. (No turning back.)</li>
        <li>After hearing this, immediately regreted taking the drug.</li>
        <li>Kicked in extremely fast (less than 20 min.)... [Extremely unusual. Normally "acid"
        takes 1 to 2 hours to kick in.] See pg 21.</li>
        <li>Felt overwhelmed/Claustrophobic / Short of breath / Dizzy/ Frightened / Felt like
        I was dying... (Initial effects of drug.) See pg 21.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>TRIAL NOTES:</h4>
      <p>
        They made a big deal about what was said; "Kill" or "Stab"; and the fact the knife was
        set down and supposedly I calmed down.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Due to this drug this was IMPOSSIBLE... I'm quoted and heard spouting out nonsense
        about Jesus and Armegeddon -- obviously drug-induced and very much out of character,
        as I was at my core agnostic if not an atheist.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Whether I sat the knife down or not, It was impossible for me to set down my psychosis.
        The point is that this drug was far more potent than anything I'd ever done before and
        hence my rational and logical thought in any sense of the word was completely absent and
        imagine it would've been for many hours to come.

      <h3>A BRIEF SUMMARY ON HOW I CAME TO BE LIVING AT THIS HOUSE</h3>
      
      I had been living in an apartment on Topeka St. in the down town area for about a
      year with my then girlfriend Colleen. My friend Brian Mangers needed a place to stay. I naturally, being me,told him
      that neWetay with me which he did for the next several months. Eventually he had an
      Opportunity to move out and in with a young friend of his that worked for him, this
      being "John Mark Hersher". Brian moving out was going to leave’ short on rent, but I
      wasn't too concerned as my oldest daughter, her fiance, and my grandson already had
      plans for them to come up to live in Wichita together with me in the hopes of working
      together as a family and trying to get ahead in the world with all of us contrib-
      uting and working together... Because of this, I told Brian to go ahead take this
      opportunity to move out and that y would only leave me high and dry for a brief period.
      and I was covered. aw myself
      
      So tay:daughter, her: fiance, and my grandson all moved in together and it worked
      well for awhile, until they realized that they really didn't like living in Wichita
      and wanted to moved to a smaller town... Now once again, me being me, I told them
      “T£ you find a place to move to, don't worry about me, and to do what you have to do."
      
      Well it wasn't more than 3 days later they found a small house in a small town and
      moved out almost immediately which although good for them really left me in a hell
      of a bind, so I called Brian and told him I needed a place to stay and being that he
      kind of owed me, naturally he let me stay with him and John Mark in a small apartment on
      Douglas Ave... I was also sort of staying with Colleen at her new apartment as we were
      trying to sort things out between each other, until once again, it became very clear that
      her and I would never be able to sort things out, and once again I had no where to go.
      
      During that time, John Mark's father had passed away and he picked up the lease on
      his father's place which basically the. entire first floor of an enormous house that was
      turned into numerous apts and was much better suited to accomodate several people, and
      he and Brian had moved in and I went and stayed there temporarily with them.
      
      <p>
        The apartment acrossed the drive way became open and Brian and his girlfriend wanted to
        move in and this meant that John Mark needed a new room mate, and it seem to be kissmate
        as I had just found a new job only a block away, it was centrally located and within
        walking distance of everything (this being ideal as I didn't have a car),so we talked
        it over and I moved in...
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It was purely based on necessity and circumstance, and this was the only reason
        I was living at this house with these young people... I felt it necessary
        to add this as it was never even remotely explained at the trial, but they sure
        did make a big deal about the age difference, and why was a 36 yr old man hanging
        around with these kids.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I believe it really worked well at making it easier for the D.A. to make me
        look bad at trial, unfortunately at trial, I was coerced, railroaded, and limited
        to only, being able to talk about the night in question, and thet was all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was just one of many things I wasn't allowed to explain.
