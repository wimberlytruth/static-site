      <p>To whom it may concern,
          This is an attempt to consolidate pertinent facts unknown in
          hopes of bringing the truth to light. For if the truth does not matter, 
          does anything? Open your mind, open your eyes and see this for what it truly is.
          I present this as it is, for what it is... An affidavit of truth.

        Sincerely,<br/>

      Although it was suspected that what I was actually given on the night in question was
      a synthetic designer drug called 25i-NBOMe, this was not presented at my trial, and was
      only briefly mentioned after the fact at my sentencing, and this is just one of the careless
      mistakes made by my incompetent lawyer Phillip White. I was not able to piece this together
      until some months after my trial as I simply did not yet have access to this information,
      (my medical records in particular) which absolutely confirms that it was in fact 25i-NBOMe,
      and was not LSD.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      My lawyer was either too stupid, or simply didn't care enough to dig any deeper than
      he felt necessary and thus, none of this was brought up in court... The way I was railroaded,
      I wonder if he was actually working against me.
    </p>
      
    <p>Keep in mind the testimony of my roomates, John Mark Herrscher and Justin Malter, whose
      sworn testimony under oath states that Andrew Langston's sole purpose for coming over
      coming to our house on the night in question was to sell me this drug in the hopes I would
      take it with him as he had already taken some and did not wish to do this alone. (See John
      Mark's testimony <a href="/transcripts/herrscher.html#link_from_affidavit_1">here</a> and
      <a href="/transcripts/herrscher.html#link_from_affidavit_2">here</a>, and Justin's testimony 
      <a href="/transcripts/malter.html#link_from_affidavit_1">here</a> and <a href="/transcripts/malter.html#link_from_affidavit_2">here</a>).
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Andrew Langston committed perjury while under oath and completely lied and denied
      everything, even going so far as to say that he had never even met me, and that he himself
      didn't sell or even use drugs. The truth of the matter is that Andrew Langston was there
      specifically to try and sell this drug (and therefore obviously knew me), and further more
      he allowed me to take this without telling me what it was and that it was, and I quote,
      "quadruple dipped." Notice the part marked "dosage curve."
      If a single dose of 25i-NBOMe is 10 or 20 times more potent, then what I took was potentially
      40 to 80 times more potent.. The point is, I did not know what I was getting into.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The truth is, I thought it was LSD, which was something I had done before
      (although the last time was about 4 years prior), and I foresaw no risk in anything I was
      doing. I wasn't paticuarly keen on taking it that night as I was exhausted from playing a
      gig with my band, The Hellhawks, the night before and then working all day at my salon
      "The Color Bar" only to run sound for a band later in the evening at "John Barleycorns."
      But when I got home after 2:00 am, and would finally be able to relax, Andrew
      <!-- pg 2 --> was there at the house waiting for me with my roomates, and he asked if I 
      wanted to "trip" with him as he had already taken it, therefore I thought I might as well 
      because if that was true, then he certainly wasn't going anywhere and would be up all night.

    <p>
      A little back story here: This was the only connection I had with this kid...
      I'd met him a few weeks prior as he was coming over alot and hanging out with my roomates
      nand alot of their other friends as well... One day Andrew just happen to come over on my
      day off to see John Mark and Justin who were still at work, I told him he could come in and
      wait for them. So he and I hung out for a good hour and a half playing video games.
      During conversation, he told me how into "Hallucinogenics" he was... I told him that I used
      to be as well but had not done it in years, to which he said, he'd let me know the next
      time he came across some which was about a week later,when he showed up with some and
      out of boredom or curiosity I bought a Hit of blotter acid off of him and held on to it
      for a few days. When-I-finally took it, I was a bit hesitant as it had been awhile, so
      I only took half of it... After a few hours had passed and nothing was happening, I
      remember thinking "Wow, this is pretty weak compared to what I remember, so I went back
      and consumed the other half, and only then did I experience any effects, even still, it
      was fairly mild but that was all I was really looking for anyway.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The Truth is I wasn't even interested in a party... Being a musician, all I was really
      Hoping to achieve was some sense of heightened creativity, just like so many of the artists
      that we've all admired and looked up to and hold in high regard... And that's all...
      If I'm guilty of anything, it was that.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      So when the opportunity presented itself on the night in question, I thought I was
      taking the same thing... I WAS NOT GIVEN FULL DISCLOSURE ABOUT ANY OF IT, and by the time
      he informed me that this was, and I quote, a "new type" of acid and that it was "quadruple 
      dipped," it was too late as I had already consumed it, and as soon as the words came out
      of his mouth, I knew this was a mistake... I told myself, "Just ride it out and then you
      can sleep all day tomorrow"... This was mere minutes before the effects of this terrible
      drug would take hold of me and ruin mine and Andrew's lives forever and this was the
      last rational thought or moment of sanity I would have until I awoke under arrest, in
      a hospital bed 4 days later unable to remember what had happened or how I'd gotten there
      with severe head trauma causing almost complete paralysis to the left side of my face.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I didn't know it yet but I was be charged with Attempted First Degree Murder while
      unbeknownst to me, Andrew Langston only rooms away laid in bed with the blade of my
      pocket knife lodged in his skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine this analogy if you will: a girl going out and a guy offers to buy
      her a drink, and she aceppts and says "Yes"... Only the guy slips a roofy in her drink.
      Later the man would try and take advantage of her and somehow she manages to stab the guy
      to get away, only to wake up and not remember a thing, and finds herself being tried
      and convicted of "Attempted First Degree Murder", anf found guilty because she accepted
      the-drink.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Do I think that Andrew was just intentionally trying to "Fuck me off"? NO... No I don't.
      I just think he was some dumb ass kid who didn't realize just what he had and what he was
      giving me. But I don't know, maybe he did. I tell you honestly, had I have been told all
      the information upfront, I could have and would have chosen not to take it, and just
      went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not trying to paint myself out to be some sort of angel... And if people want to
      say,"Oh, he's too old to be doing that stuff anyway and I should heve known better, hey,
      I'll take that stuff all day (even it may be coming from a bunch of hypocrites with their
      own flaws and addictions, whatever they may be), because guess what; they're probably
      right and I was too old to be messing with anything like that. So BOOM! You got me there...
      However, as I said at my sentencing, "I know who I am and who I am not"... I am NOT some
      sort of would be murderer, and I have never wanted to or meant to hurt anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      People can say, think and believe whatever the hell they want to, and I don't really
      give a damn what they think, and not to sound apathetic or misanthropic, but most people
      are ignorant and make up their own truths anyway, and their opinion is not only useless,
      it's irrelevant. That being said, what I am telling you is the truth --
      substantiated by facts, evidence, and the testimony of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I can remember or not, I hurt someone. And although it was not premeditated,
      contrived or intentional, it is true. I tried to take what I felt was my share of the
      responsibility for this by telling the jury to find me guilty of a lesser offense,
      because First Degree Attempted Murder requires both Intent and Premeditation.
      
      If Andrew is so innocent, why did he lie about so much? Was he just a hapless bystander
      who accidentally walked into the path of a homicidal maniac?
      Is that the real story? That's what my conviction implies. But is it true? His own mother
      does not think so
    </p>
    <p>
      I've provided documentation, so you may see the facts and evidence
      with your own eyes (facts which were never conclusively established in court). My hope is that you will come away with an informed opinion, 
      and hopefully see this for what it really was: and
      a terrible tragedy, and not a premeditated, intentional plot to murder or hurt someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what it's worth, the only purpose in writing this letter is to shed some light on
      the acutal truth of the matter. I have no reason to lie. My entire life -- the good, the
      bad, and the ugly -- has been completely exposed, dissected, and scrutinized (with emphasis on the
      bad) in ways that most will never experience or comprehend, and I sincerely hope they
      never have to. This experience has been the most excrutiatingly painful and humiliating thing
      I've ever had to endure, and on all levels albeit mentally, physically, emotionally,
      and spiritually... I cannot begin to describe the strangeness of harboring so much remorse and regret for something I
      can't even fully recollect. Though I am reminded of it everytime I look in the mirror to
      see the nerve damage in my face (now 6yrs. on) due to my own injuries that I incurred
      that night. Judging from my condition, I can only assume that Andrew is still being
      affected by, and is trying to recooperate and heal from his injuries as well and I
      sincerely hope that he does... I hope we both do... I will say this though, although
      most of the emphasis was placed on him and his injuries, both of us suffered severe head
      trauma, and in reality both of us are lucky to be alive... The only difference is that
      Andrew has had the love, care, and support of all those around him, not to mention
      medical care, while I on the other hand was thrown into a cell to fend for my self and
      essentially told "good luck", and that is a fact... That said, even though he lied in court, 
      I have no ill will towards him, never did, and if he had died I could not have lived with myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's interesting to note though: had the coin been flipped, if I'd died that night, 
      then Andrew Langston and possibly John Mark Hersher could have both potentially
      been tried for murder or conspiracy to commit murder. Regardless, I am thankful and
      happy that we are both alive. I sincerely wish him well and have wished
      that from the beginning. Maybe someday he will come to terms with what really happened that night.
      I hope so, because it matters. The truth always matters. Whether he wants to admit or
      not, he knows that had he not given me the counterfeit LSD, or if he had at least
      been upfront and honest about it, then none of this would have ever happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange thing is, that he wasn't being charged and would not be charged for anything, 
      and hence wasn't being motivated by fear... I can only assume that this to him was revenge, 
      for him and his father. I hope he can at least be honest with himself about that as he 
      certainly wasn't in court, and now I have indisputable and incontestable proof. It is 
      simply a matter of cause and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no beef or dispute between us. There was no motive or motivation whatsoever
      to have caused such a violent outburst... The ONLY "cause" of this whole thing was the
      drug itself, and we all know the aftermath.
      This is the truth, substantiated by facts. Andrew and I both know the truth. And now you 
      will too. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I humbly ask and encourage you 
      to share this information in any way you can.

    <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
    <p>
      I've also sent along some definitions pulled from Black's Law Dictionary and Webster's College Dictionary to reference and exemplify that in my
      "State of Mind" on the night, I simply was not able to form the necessary requirements
      of Intent and Pre-meditation.

    <p>
      Intent and Premeditation were both needed to have been found guilty of Attempted First Degree Murder.

      In summation, I have been overcharged, and never should have been found guilty of this

    <h3>Notes on the Trial</h3>

    <p>
      They made a big deal about what was said; "Kill" or "Stab"; and the fact the knife was
      set down and supposedly I calmed down.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Due to this drug this was IMPOSSIBLE... I'm quoted and heard spouting out nonsense
      about Jesus and Armegeddon -- obviously drug-induced and very much out of character,
      as I was at my core agnostic if not an atheist.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Whether I sat the knife down or not, It was impossible for me to set down my psychosis.
      The point is that this drug was far more potent than anything I'd ever done before and
      hence my rational and logical thought in any sense of the word was completely absent and
      imagine it would've been for many hours to come.

  <div class="content" id="house">
    <h3>A Brief Summary of How I Came to Live at the House</h3>
    <p>
      I had been living in an apartment on Topeka St. in the downtown area for about a
      year with my then girlfriend Colleen... it was a rocky relationship, but that's another
      story. My friend, Brian Mangers, needed a place to stay.
      I naturally, being me, told him that neWetay with me which he did for the next several months. 
      Eventually he had an opportunity to move out and in with a young friend of his that worked 
      for him, this being John Mark Hersher. Brian moving out was going to leave me short on rent, 
      but I wasn't too concerned as my oldest daughter, her fiance, and my grandson already had
      plans for them to come up to live in Wichita together with me in the hopes of working
      together as a family and trying to get ahead in the world with all of us contributing and 
      working together... Because of this, I told Brian to go ahead take this opportunity to move 
      out and that it would only leave me high and dry for a brief period and I was covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      So my daughter, her fiance, her grandson and myself, all moved in together and it worked
      well for awhile, until they realized that they really didn't like living in Wichita
      and wanted to moved to a smaller town. Now once again, me being me, I told them
      “If you find a place to move to, don't worry about me, do what you have to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Well it wasn't more than 3 days later they found a small house in a small town and
      moved out almost immediately which although good for them really left me in a hell
      of a bind, so I called Brian and told him I needed a place to stay and being that he
      kind of owed me, naturally he let me stay with him and John Mark in a small apartment on
      Douglas Ave... I was also sort of staying with Colleen at her new apartment as we were
      trying to sort things out between each other, until once again, it became very clear that
      her and I would never be able to sort things out, and once again I had no where to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that time, John Mark's father had passed away and he picked up the lease on
      his father's place, which was basically the entire first floor of an enormous house that was
      turned into numerous apartments, and it was much better suited to accomodate several people, and
      he and Brian had moved in and I went and stayed there temporarily with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment acrossed the drive way became open and Brian and his girlfriend wanted to
      move in and this meant that John Mark needed a new room mate, and it seem to be kissmate
      as I had just found a new job only a block away, it was centrally located and within
      walking distance of everything (this being ideal as I didn't have a car), so we talked
      it over and I moved in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was purely based on necessity and circumstance, and this was the only reason
      I was living at this house with these young people... I felt it necessary
      to add this as it was never even remotely explained at the trial, but they sure
      did make a big deal about the age difference, and why was a 36 yr old man hanging
      around with these kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe it really worked well at making it easier for the D.A. to make me
      look bad at trial, unfortunately at trial, I was coerced, railroaded, and limited
      to only, being able to talk about the night in question, and thet was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was just one of many things I wasn't allowed to explain.
