This is the basic command; the first argument is the file to apply the OCR to; the second argument is the output file.

	tesseract page1.png page1 -l eng


Here's a pair of shell scripts I used to OCR all of the png files in a directory. Each script is just a simple loop. I tried to combine them by using a conditional statement, but it failed and I don't think that going deep into bash/shell scripting is a good use of my time right now.

The first loop is for the first 9 files. The second loop is for the rest of the files (10 and above).

	for i in {1..9}
	do
  	  tesseract 1-0$i.png output$i -l eng
	done

	for i in {10..28}
	do
	  tesseract 1-$i.png output$i -l eng
        done

Here's another script for merging the text into a single file.

        for i in {1..28}
        do
          cat output$i.txt >> all.txt
        done
