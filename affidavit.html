      To whom it may concern,<br />
      This is an attempt to consolidate pertinent facts unknown in
      hopes of bringing the truth to light. For if the truth does not matter, 
      does anything?<br/>
      Open your mind, open your eyes and see this for what it truly is.
      I present this as it is, for what it is... An affidavit of truth.

    Although it was suspected that what I was actually given on the night in question was
    a synthetic designer drug called "NBOM 251", this was not presented at my trial, and was
    only briefly mentioned after the fact at my sentencing, and this is just one of the careless
    mistakes made by my incompetent lawyer "Phillip White". I was not able to piece this together
    until some months after my trial as I simply did not yet have access to this information,
    (my medical records in paticular) which absolutely confirms that it was in fact. "NBOM 251",
    and was not "LSD".
  </p>
    
  <p>
    My lawyer was either too stupid, or simply didn't care enough to dig any deeper than
    he felt necessary and thus, none of this was brought up in court... The way I was railroaded,
    I wonder if he was actually working against me.
  </p>
    
  <p>Keep in mind the testimony of my roomates, John Mark Herrscher and Justin Malter, whose
    sworn testimony under oath states that Andrew Langston's sole purpose for coming over
    coming to our house on the night in question was to sell me this drug in the hopes I would
    take it with him as he had already taken some and did not wish to do this alone. (See John
    Marks testimony (pg. 39 & 45), and Justins testimony (pg 70 & 74).</p>
    
  <p>Andrew Langston committed perjury while under oath and completely lied and denied
    everything, even going so far as to say that he had never even met me,*and that he himself
    didn't sell or even use drugs. The truth of the matter is that Andrew Langston was there
    specifically to try and sebl this drugâ€™(and therefore obviously knew me), and further more
    he allowed me to take this without telling me what it was and that it was, and I quote,
    "Quadruple dipped! Notice; On the information pages(A}), the part marked "Dosage Curve";
    If a single dose of NBOMe 25T is 10 or 20 times more potent, then waht I took was potentially
    40 to 80 times more potent),.. The point is, I did not know what I was getting into.</p>

  <p>
    The truth is, I thought it was LSD, which in truth was something I had done before
    (although the last time was about 4 years prior), and I foresaw no risk in anything I was
    doing. I wasn't paticuarly keen on taking it that night as I was exhausted from playing a
    gig with my band, The Hellhawks, the night before and then working all day at my salon
    "The Color Bar" only to run sound for a band later in the evening at "John Barleycorns",
    however when I finally got home after 2:00 am, and would finally be able to relax, Andrew
    <!-- pg 1 ends, with annotations --> was there at the house waiting for me with my roomates, 
    and he asked if I wanted to "trip" with him as he had already taken it, therefore I thought 
    I might as well because if that was true, then he certainly wasn't going anywhere and would 
    be up all night.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    A little back story here: This was the only connection I had with this kid...
    I'd met him a few weeks prior as he was coming over alot and hanging out with my roomates
    nand alot of their other friends as well... One day Andrew just happen to come over on my
    day off to see John Mark and Justin who were still at work, I told him he could come in and
    wait for them. So he and I hung out for a good hour and a half palying video games.
    During conversation, he told me how into "Hallucinogenics" he was... I told him that I used
    to be as well but had not done it in years, to which he said, he'd let me know the next
    time he came across some which was about a week later,when he showed up with some and
    out of boredom or curiosity I bought a Hit of blotter acid off of him and held on to it
    for a few days. When-I-finally took it, I was abit hesitant as it had been awhile, so
    I only took half of it... After a few hours had passed and nothing was happening, I
    remember thinking "Wow, this is pretty weak compared to what I remember, so I went back
    Nand consumed the other half, and only then did I experience any effects, even still, it
    was fairly mild but that was all I was really looking for anyway.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Truth is I wasn't even interested in a party... Being a musician, all I was really
    Hdping to achieve was some sense of hightened creativity, just like so many of the artists
    that we've all admired and looked up to and hold in high regard... And that's all...
    If I'm guilty of anything, it was that.
  </p>

  <p>
    So when the opportunity presented itself on the night in question, I thought I was
    taking the same thing... I WAS NOT GIVEN FULL DISCLOSURE ABOUT ANY OF IT, and by the time
    he informed me that this was, and I quote, a "new type" of acid and that it was "quadruple 
    dipped," it was too late as I had already consumed it, and as soon as the words came out
    of his mouth, I knew this was a mistake... I told myself, "Just ride it out and then you
    can sleep all day tomorrow"... This was mere minutes before the effects of this terrible
    drug would take hold of me and ruin mine and Andrew's lives forever and this was the
    last rational thought or moment of sanity I would have until I awoke under arrest, in
    a hospital bed 4 days later unable to remember what had happened or how I'd gotten there
    with severe head trauma causing almost complete paralysis to the left side of my face.
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn't know it yet but I was be charged with Attempted First Degree Murder while
    unbeknownst to me, Andrew Langston only rooms away laid in bed with the blade of my
    pocket knife lodged in his skull.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Imagine this analogy if you will: a girl going out and a guy offers to buy
    her a drink, and she aceppts and says "Yes"... Only the guy slips a "Ruffy" in her drink.
    Later the man would try and take advantage of her and somehow she manages to stab the guy
    to get away, only to wake up and not remember a thing, and finds herself being tried
    and convicted of "Attempted First Degree Murder", anf found guilty because she accepted
    the-drink.
  </p> 

  <p>
    Do I think that Andrew was just intentionally trying to "Fuck me off"? NO... No I don't.
    I just think he was some dumb ass kid who didn't realize just what he had and what he was
    giving me. But I don't know, maybe he did. I tell you honestly, had I have been told all
    the information upfront, I could have and would have chosen not to take it, and just
    went to bed.
      
  </p>
    <p>
      I'm not trying to paint myself out to be some sort of angel... And if people want to
      say,"Oh, he's too old to be doing that stuff anyway and I should hve known better, hey,
      I'll take that stuff all day (even it may be coming from a bunch of hypocrites with their
      own flaws and addictions, whatever they may be), because guess what; they're probably
      right and I was too old to be messing with anything like that. So BOOM! You got me there...
      However, as I said at my sentencing, "ZI know who I am and who I am not"... I am NOT some
      sort of would be murderer, and I have never wanted to ot meant to hurt anyone.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      People can say and think and believe whatever the hell they want to, and I don't really
      give a damn what they think, and not to sound apathetic or misanthropic, but most people
      are ignorant and make up their awn truths anyway, and their opinion is not only useless,
      it's irrelevant... That being said, what I am telling you is not only the actual TRUTH,
      it is substantiated by actual facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I can remeber or not, I hurt someone... And although it was not premeditated,
      contrived or intentional, it is true. I tried to take what I felt was my share of the
      responsibility for this by telling the jury to find me quilty of "Aggravated Battery",
      which without Intent and Premeditation is exactly what it was, but if Andrew really is
      this poor innocent little angel, then why did he feel the need to not only lie about a
      few things, but lie about practically EVERYTHING?
    </p>
    <p>
      I've sent you only a small bit of all the information I actually have so as you may see
      for yourself, with your own eyes in black and white the actual facts (that were never
      conclusively established in court), so that you and whoever else that may read this can
      atleast have a more informed opinion, and hopefully see this for what it really was, and
      that is a terrible and traggic accident, and not some grand premeditated/intentional plot
      to attempt to murder or even to hurt someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what it's worth, the only purpose in writing this letter is to shed some light on
      the acutal truth of the matter. I have no reason to lie. My entire life -- the good, the
      bad, and the ugly -- has been completely exposed dissected and scrutinized (with emphasis on the
      bad) in ways that most will never experince or even comprhend, and I sincerely hope they
      never have to. This experiencehas been the most excrutiatingly painful and humiliating thing
      IT have:ever had to endure and on all levels albeit mentally, physically, emotionally,
      and spiritually... I cannot even begin to describ the strangeness of the almost nightly
      occurence of being tortured by the fellings of uttr remorse and regret for something I
      can't even fully recollect, only to be reminded of it everytime I look in the mirror to
      see the nerve damage in my face (now 6yrs. on) due to my own injuries that I incurred
      that night. Judging from my condition, I can only assume that Andrew is still being
      affected by, and is trying to recooperate and heal from his injuries as well and I
      sincerely hope that he does... I hope we both do... I will say this though, although
      most of the emphasis was placed on him and his injuries, both of us suffered severe head
      trauma, and in reality both of us are lucky to be alive... The only difference is that
      Andreu has had the love, care, and support of all those around him, not to mention
      medical care, while I on the other hand was thrown into a cell to fend for my self and
      essentially told "good luck", and that is a fact... That being said, and aside from his
      lying in court, I have no ill will towards him, never did, and had he have died, I literally
      could not have lived with myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's interesting to note though, had the coin been flipped, and had I have died that
      night, then Andrew Langston and possibly John Mark Hersher could have both pitentially
      been tried for murder or conspiracy to commit murder. Regardless, I am very thankful and
      very happy to say that we are both alive, and I sincerely wish him well and have wished
      that from the very begining... who knows, maybe someday his conscience will get the best
      of him and he may finally admit the role he played in this... I hope so... Regardless of
      if he ever does or not, I know, that deep down inside of him, whether he wants to admit or
      not, that he knows that had he not have given me this terrible drug, or had he atleast
      been upfront and honest about it, then none of this would have ever happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The really strange thing is that he wasn't being charged and would not be charged
      for anything, and hence wasn't being motivated by fear... I can only assume that this to
      him was revenge,for him and his father... I haope he can atleast be honest with himself
      about that as he certainly wasn't in court, and now I have indisputable and incontestable
      proof of it... It is simply cause and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no beef or dispute between us. There was no motive or motivation whatsoever
      to have caused such a violent outburst... The ONLY "cause" of this whole thing was the
      drug itself, and we all know the aftermath.
      This is the absolute truth of it all, substantiated by actual fact... I know it...
      He knows it... And now, whoever is reading this will know it to...
      Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I humbly ask and encourage you to
      share this information in any way you can.
